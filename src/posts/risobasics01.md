So you're on this website and don't know about risograph printing? Quite strange. Either way, this post is your intro to what a risograph is, how it works, and why artists choose to use it. Enjoy!

### What is Risograph?
Risograph or RISO prints are made using a risograph printer. A type of duplicator whose process can best be described as a blend of screen printing and traditional CMYK printing. Using spot coloring and machine-made stencils, it prints out each color individually, layering one over the previous.

### History of the Risograph
Ok now for some background. In 1980s Japan, Noboru Hayama, inspired by the low maintenance cost and ease of use of the mimeograph, decided to create a new type of duplicator. This one, taking the best parts of the mimeograph, also introduced high-speed printing, and low-cost inks. After it's success the risograph was quickly picked up by schools and offices all across Japan, and later in the West.

### How does it work?
First the printer needs your image, which can be scanned physically or sent as a file from a computer. Using this scan, a master is created by burning tiny holes, corresponding to color areas on your image, onto a master sheet (think of it like a screen during the screen-printing process). This master is then wrapped around an ink drum. When paper runs through the printer, the spinning drum pushes ink through the previously created holes, leaving a copy of your image on your paper.

### Why use a RISO?
RISO inks have a unique texture and will always come out looking a little bit different than the last. This gives prints a hand-made feel and each print their own individuality. Happy imperfections.The separate ink per drum approach means that you can get unique colors that a regular CMYK cannot achieve, like fluorescent pink or metallic gold. The fact that you are in control of every color, the order in which they are printed, the alignment, an ink's opacity, means that the artists job does not end when printing begins, they are a part of the process throughout a print's entire journey.

Good job! You are basically a risograph pro now. Next time you're at trivia and they ask a hyper-niche question about late 20th century printing techniques and duplicators from Japan, which are eco-friendly and use soy (now sometimes rice) based inks, I hope you impress your trivia group!
